I have to admit that I love to do groceries. I'm living in Ireland at the moment and the supermarket is just 5 minutes from my home. I usually go there 2/3 times a week since I have to walk there and bring everything in a small trolley.

I'm pretty sure that the prices are getting higher and higher really quick but I just have my memory to check this, right? WRONG!

As a data scientist I'm always looking on everything as a possible data to be use. It seems crazy to think in that way, but for me is fun. So I've being working with a Grocery management app to get insights about my groceries tendencies.

So the idea is to create an app registering the groceries, with date, supermarket, values, discounts and then analyse several things.

### Groceries insights

Here are some things that it came to my mind when analyzing the data:

-   How many groceries per month/week

-   Average total spent per grocery/month/week

-   Most purchased products by month/year

-   Changes in the price of products and witch one get the highest difference

-   Percentage of the increase on the price

-   How much we spent on each product by month/year

-   Analysis by type and subtype of products

-   More expensive product and least expensive product

-   Comparison between supermarket prices

-   Identify peak spending periods and see if they correspond to specific events or seasonal changes.

-   how much was saved from discounts and identify if there are specific products or periods where discounts are most frequent

-   Find out which discounts lead to the most savings and see if there are opportunities to use them more effectively

-   Analyze if there is a shift in the type or subtype of products and correlate with health or lifestyle goals

### Framework

I love working with Shiny. It could be complex for some people, but have the freedom to change almost everything (or if you are more expert, change literally everything) is fantastic.

For this app I am going to use Rhino from Appsilon and the goal is to use all that I learned in the course *ProductioniZing Shiny Applications* by Veerle van Leemput.

I'll be honest, I have more than 3 years building Shiny apps, but before this course I didn't know how complex and complete working with Shiny could be. So I'm excited to try everything in a more professional way.

LET'S GET STARTED!
