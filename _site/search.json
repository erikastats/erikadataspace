    "text": "I have to admit that I love to do groceries. I’m living in Ireland at the moment and the supermarket is just 5 minutes from my home. I usually go there 2/3 times a week since I have to walk there and bring everything in a small trolley.\nI’m pretty sure that the prices are getting higher and higher really quick but I just have my memory to check this, right? WRONG!\nAs a data scientist I’m always looking on everything as a possible data to be use. It seems crazy to think in that way, but for me is fun. So I’ve being working with a Grocery management app to get insights about my groceries tendencies.\nSo the idea is to create an app registering the groceries, with date, supermarket, values, discounts and then analyse several things.\n\nGroceries insights\nHere are some things that it came to my mind when analyzing the data:\n\nHow many groceries per month/week\nAverage total spent per grocery/month/week\nMost purchased products by month/year\nChanges in the price of products and witch one get the highest difference\nPercentage of the increase on the price\nHow much we spent on each product by month/year\nAnalysis by type and subtype of products\nMore expensive product and least expensive product\nComparison between supermarket prices\nIdentify peak spending periods and see if they correspond to specific events or seasonal changes.\nhow much was saved from discounts and identify if there are specific products or periods where discounts are most frequent\nFind out which discounts lead to the most savings and see if there are opportunities to use them more effectively\nAnalyze if there is a shift in the type or subtype of products and correlate with health or lifestyle goals\n\n\n\nFramework\nI love working with Shiny. It could be complex for some people, but have the freedom to change almost everything (or if you are more expert, change literally everything) is fantastic.\nFor this app I am going to use Rhino from Appsilon and the goal is to use all that I learned in the course ProductioniZing Shiny Applications by Veerle van Leemput.\nI’ll be honest, I have more than 3 years building Shiny apps, but before this course I didn’t know how complex and complete working with Shiny could be. So I’m excited to try everything in a more professional way.\nLET’S GET STARTED!"
